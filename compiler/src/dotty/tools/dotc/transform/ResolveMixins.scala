/** This phase adds super accessors and mixin forwarders where
 *  linearization differs from Java's rule for default methods in interfaces.
 *  In particular:
 *
 *        For every trait M directly implemented by the class (see SymUtils.mixin), in
 *        reverse linearization order, add the following definitions to C:
 *
 *          3.1 (done in `superAccessors`) For every superAccessor
 *              `<mods> def super$f[Ts](ps1)...(psN): U` in M:
 *
 *                <mods> def super$f[Ts](ps1)...(psN): U = super[S].f[Ts](ps1)...(psN)
 *
 *              where `S` is the superclass of `M` in the linearization of `C`.
 *
 *          3.2 (done in `mixinForwarders`) For every method
 *              `<mods> def f[Ts](ps1)...(psN): U` in M` that needs to be disambiguated:
 *
 *                <mods> def f[Ts](ps1)...(psN): U = super[M].f[Ts](ps1)...(psN)
 *
 *        A method in M needs to be disambiguated if it is concrete, not overridden in C,
 *        and if it overrides another concrete method.
 *
 *  This is the first part of what was the mixin phase. It is complemented by
 *  Mixin, which runs after erasure.

                |
                |1. One of its parent ($mixin) contains a call $superCall in its body,
                |   and when a super-call in a trait is written without an explicit parent
                |   listed in brackets, it is implemented by a generated super-accessor in
                |   the class that extends this trait based on the linearization order of
                |   the class.
                |2. Because ${cur.name} comes before ${mixin.name} in the linearization
                |   order of ${base.name}, and because ${cur.name} overrides $memberName,
                |   the super-accessor in ${base.name} is implemented as a call to
                |   $resolvedSuperCall.
                |3. However,
                |   ${otherTp.widenExpr} (the type of $resolvedSuperCall in ${base.name})
                |   is not a subtype of
                |   ${accTp.widenExpr} (the type of $memberName in $mixin).
                |   Hence, the super-accessor that needs to be generated in ${base.name}
                |   is illegal.

                |Here are two possible ways to resolve this:
                |
                |1. Change the linearization order of ${base.name} such that
                |   ${mixin.name} comes before ${cur.name}.
                |2. Alternatively, replace $superCall in the body of $mixin by a
                |   super-call to a specific parent, e.g. $staticSuperCall
                |""".stripMargin, base.sourcePos)

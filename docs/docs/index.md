title: "Dotty Documentation"
---

Dotty is a platform to try out new language concepts and compiler technologies for Scala. 
The focus is mainly on simplification. We remove extraneous syntax (e.g. no XML literals), 
and try to boil down Scalaâ€™s types into a smaller set of more fundamental constructors. 
The theory behind these constructors is researched in DOT, a calculus for dependent object types.

In this documentation you will find information on how to use the Dotty compiler on your machine, navigate through
the code, setup Dotty with your favorite IDE and more!
